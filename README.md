# Instructions and preparation

In this project, we investigated whether the instruction-based congruency effect could be adjusted to the appearance of a cue. The associated work can be found at [Munin]().

## Abstract

Humans display an ability to rapidly adapt behaviour to novelly instructed relations.
Instructions typically bind known stimuli and responses in novel ways that must be retained
for future implementation, which can induce unintentional effects on a secondary task. This
effect can be adjusted based on the degree of preparation for the retained instruction. Cues can
be used to explicitly signal upcoming task demands, such that the degree of preparation for
the retained instructions can be adjusted. To investigate whether preparation can be adjusted
to an explicit cue, I used a novel design implemented in the instruction-based literature. A cue
was presented a couple of trials before the trial related to the retained instruction was
presented. I hypothesized that the effect on the secondary task would be reduced or absent
before the cue but present after the cue. The analysis revealed the expected pattern when
considering time as an interacting factor in the analysis. Thus, only the later parts of the
experiment indicated the expected pattern, while the earlier and middle parts of the
experiment did not. The evidence suggests that practice is necessary to attenuate preparation
before the cue, in line with prior research.
